# Hangman-Game

Hangman in node land

Play hangman in Node. The theme is cities surrounding the Kansas City Metro area. You get twelve guesses to get the letters in the word correct. Guess any letter (a-z) and see if you can guess the correct city. If you can guess all the letters in the word without running out of guesses then you win, but if not you lose!

This is a solo project I did for class

Before you start you will need to download node inquirer and is-letter.
This will allow me to ask you questions for the game and check to see if the key you pressed is an actual letter (a-z) and not a number or symbol.

Thanks for checking out my project!
